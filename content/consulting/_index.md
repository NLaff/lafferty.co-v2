Here's a few things I can do to help grow your business. Feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:nick@lafferty.co) to discuss anything in more detail. 

## Paid Search Account Audits
I've spent [millions of dollars on Google Ads](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/i-spent-6-million-on-google-ads-last-year-here-s-what-i-learned) managing B2C and B2B campaigns for Lead Gen, SaaS, Education, and a whole lot more industries. I'll take a look at your account and quickly tell you what I think is going well, what isn't, and provide a roadmap of actionable next-steps to take your advertising to the next level.

## Landing Page Optimization
What good is spending millions of dollars on advertising if your landing pages don't convert? Conversion rate optimization is so much more than testing the color of a button. Send me your URLs, tell me how traffic gets there and what you think is going wrong. I'll help you turn your landing pages around with a laundry list of ideas to test and things to optimize. No page is perfect forever. 

## Hiring
Looking to hire the next rockstar digital marketer for your team? I've helped hire dozens of folks for  paid search, SEO, product marketing, content, email and more. I can be an unbiased 3rd party to make sure you find the absolute best fit for your team. I also like to think I've built up a pretty dang good network of hard working and super smart folks, too. I'd be glad to make an intro or recommend anyone I think would be a great fit. 

## Digital Marketing Strategy
Want to pick my brain for an hour? I'm always happy to chat and make a connection. I pride myself on staying current on the ever-changing world of digital marketing.
