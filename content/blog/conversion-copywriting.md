## Conversion Copywriting 101
Conversion copywriting is persuasive writing that sells you on a product or service. Good conversion copy results in you making a purchase or taking final action.

Conversion copywriting applies data and research to help make a persuasive argument. A bold claim proves nothing.

Copy that claims to be the "best" or "#1 service" is an example of what conversion copywriting is not.

![Not Conversion Copywriting Example](/uploads/number1window.png)

Claiming to be #1 doesn't actually proove that you're #1.

Broad claims are unbelievable because anyone can say it.

Let's break down this statement:

> I'm the best digital marketer!

If I truly am the best digital marketer, what would my experience look like?

I'd probably:
* Have a wildly successful blog with tens of thousands of visitors every day
* Run my own digital marketing agency with big clients
* Have a cabinet full of awards and honors
* Written a book on digital marketing

Now, if those things were true, my claim would look a lot different. 

Consider these instead:

> "A New York Times Best Selling Author, Nick Lafferty Is a Digital Marketing Expert" (Authority)

> "Winner of the Best Digital Marketer Award 5 times in a row, Nick Lafferty..." (Specificity)

> "Working with clients like Spotify, Zoom, and Uber, Nick Lafferty has helped transform digital marketing strategies for dozens of Fortune 500 companies" (Social Proof)

Compare those to my initial "I'm the best" statement. What is more persuasive?

The difference between regular copy and conversion copy is **making a persuasive argument**. 

A persuasive argument is based on credibility. People have to believe what you're saying before they're persuaded. 

Credibility is made up of three elements
1. Social proof
2. Authority
3. Specificity

## What is Social Proof?
![CXL Social Proof](/uploads/cxl-proof.png)
Social proof is jumping off a bridge because everyone else is doing it. 

It's that row of logos on every software website under the text "Our Customers Love Us".

Social proof says "we're really good, all these other people think so, so you should too".

Social proof is 5-star reviews across 10 different review websites. It's customer quotes, testimonials, and case studies plastered over your website.

Social proof is key to conversion copywriting today because it's external validation that you're as good as you say you are.

Look, every company says they're great at what they do. What company wouldn't? 

Social proof adds credibility to that claim from external sources. 

## Credibility by Authority
Who are you more likely to believe, an expert or a random person on the internet?

Experts are authoratative sources on a given subject because they've put in the time and effort and they have the pedigree to proove it.

Experts are backed by years of experience. They're interviewed on TV, have written books, and have published papers in academic journals. 

For conversion copywriting, authority is established by answering the question "why should I listen to you?".

## Specific Claims Are Believable

What sounds better?

> "Achieve a record number of sales"

> "Double your sales in 60 days"

Specificity makes your claim believable because it's harder to call bullshit. If you can claim a specific number, then you can likely back that up.

It's the difference between saying "We're the #1 Window Company in Austin" and "Voted #1 Window Company By The Austin Chronicle 10 Years In A Row".

## Wrapping Up
Conversion copy persuades your users to take action, usually by purchasing your product or signing up for your service.

Good conversion copy smashes objections and provides all the reasons why they **should** take action, through social proof, authority, and specificity. 

Conversion copy can also help [improve your cover letters](/blog/cover-letters/) so you stand out from the crowd.
