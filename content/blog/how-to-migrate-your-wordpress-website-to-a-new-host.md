## Summary

A step-by-step walkthrough of how to migrate your Wordpress website from the Free plan to a new hosting provider.

I'll be using [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/nicklafferty).

## Choose A New Host

I'm choosing Bluehost because of cost(plans start at $2.95/month) and they seem highly recommended.
