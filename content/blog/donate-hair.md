I've had long hair for the last 6 years but I decided I wanted to cut it all off and donate my hair to charity. 

The charity I chose is [Children With Hair Loss](https://www.childrenwithhairloss.us/).

I started growing my hair out after I got my first full-time job. I work in technology so as long as I got my job done my bosses never cared what I looked like.

Over time I learned how to take care of my long hair. My hair is curly so I tried all kinds of products to bring out the curls in my hair and prevent tangles.

A coworker recommended I check out co-wash, also known as cleansing conditioner, which was a complete game changer for my hair. 

But after 6 years it was time for a new look. I spent time researching how to donate my hair and I found some conflicting information.

The process is really simple, so I wanted to write about it.

## How to Donate Hair

5. Place hair in a ziplock bag and mail it to the charity of your choice. 
6. Celebrate!

## Hair Donation Questions
I had a lot of questions as I was researching how to best cut my hair for donation.

### How long does hair have to be to donate?
Many charities ask for at least 12 inches of length. Some, like Children With Hair Loss, ask for at least 8 inches. The longer the better as it allows them to make longer wigs. 

### How to cut hair for donation?
Hair needs to be bound together, either in pig tails or with hair ties every two inches. Hair should be at least 12 inches long, with hair ties at the beginning and end of the section to hold it together. 

### Can men donate hair?
Yes, as long as it's well-kept and there's at least 12 inches to donate.

### How to store donated hair
Hair should be stored in an air-tight ziplock bag.
