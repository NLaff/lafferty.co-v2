Monday.com is a work management tool for teams small and large. Whether you manage three employees or 3,000, this cutting-edge app has a solution for you. Sound like it might be useful? In this Monday.com review, we'll go over the app's most popular features. We'll also look at a few of Monday's top competitors to see how they measure up.

If you're looking to start the work week off right, it may be time for Monday.

## **What is Monday.com?**

![Monday Software Review](/uploads/Monday_Header.png)

[Monday](https://click.nicklafferty.com/monday), formerly known as dapulse, is business management software designed for teams. It can be used in various business-oriented capacities, from project management and marketing pipelines to human resources and customer relationship management.

The Monday software OS provides everything your company needs, effectively transforming your phone, tablet, or desktop into an all-in-one digital workspace. Create custom boards, add and tag tasks, then view your business' entire workflow from a Kanban, calendar, or chart lens to attain meaningful insights about overall productivity. With user permissions, activity logs, and time-tracking, every team member can view and contribute as needed, bringing entire workplaces under one (digital) roof.

Monday is one of the largest business management SAAS' on the market, [with 765 employees](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mondaydotcom/) and a [market valuation of roughly 1.8 billion](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/dapulse-series-d--30f12b93). It's also the weapon of choice for giga-companies like Adobe, Coca-Cola, and NBC, who rely on Monday to manage company operations alongside thousands of employees.

But is Monday right for *your* business? Let's find out.

## **Monday.com Review**

![Monday Project Management](/uploads/Monday_Boards.png)

When you sign up and log in to Monday for the first time, the app guides you through a short tutorial showcasing all the basic features. You'll see an overview of the different sections within Monday's backend and even get the chance to create your very first board, or project hub.

The tutorial is similar to other company's intro wizards, with one major caveat. That is, the tutorial is hardly necessary.

Monday's UI is **gorgeous**, with clearly defined sections, pleasant colors, and minimal clutter. Despite the vast quantity of features available, viewing and understand the different elements within Monday's workspace is clear as can be.

It's so inviting, in fact, that it's hard to resist simply jumping in and discovering the myriad tools and features available to you!

But a word of caution. Before you start building your new work interface, you should consider the different plans. The last thing you want to do is spend hours creating a workflow, only to realize that the features you added are locked behind the insanely-priced Enterprise plan.

### **Monday Pricing**

![Monday Pricing](/uploads/Monday_Pricing.png)

Monday offers four different pricing plans, including the Basic, Standard, Pro, and Enterprise plans.

How much does monday.com cost? Let's break it down:

#### Pricing
| Plan | Pricing(Annual) | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| Basic | $8/month/user |
| Standard | $10/month/user |
| Pro | $16/month/user |
| Enterprise | Custom |

Although Monday's pricing appears reasonable at first glance, it may prove too expensive for small businesses, and it's not at all suitable for solopreneurs. That's because Monday requires users to purchase *at least* three team seats, meaning the real cost of Monday starts at $24/month for the Basic plan and $48/month for the Pro plan.

Why such a large discrepancy between pricing? Different plans offer different features, with each tier up boasting the previous tier's functionality alongside a suite of extras.

What's the ideal plan for your business? Well, that all depends on which features you need.

### **Monday Features**

It's tricky to put into words how many features Monday offers. As an all-in-one platform for hundreds of different industries, it's loaded with tools for managing every aspect of your business.

Let's take a look at the different plans and the functionality you can expect from each one.

#### Basic Features

![Monday Basic Features](/uploads/Monday_Basic.png)

First up is the Basic plan. Since there's no free plan, the Basic plan is Monday's least expensive option. Unfortunately, it lacks what many users might consider essentials, including tools like calendars, integrations, and even the ability to create project templates for your team.

That said, you *do* gain access to Kanban boards with various column types, basic activity logs, and a few gigabytes of storage. But if that's what you're after, you're much better off choosing something like [Trello](https://trello.com/), which offers a free plan and specializes in Kanban.

To be totally honest, the fact that the Basic plan starts at $24 per month is ridiculous, and brings Monday's overall value down several notches. If you're serious about using Monday, you're way better off shelling out an extra $2 per user to access the Standard plan.

#### Standard Features

![Monday Standard Features](/uploads/Monday_Standard.png)

Next we have the Standard plan, which is where Monday starts to shine.

The Standard plan begins at $10 per user and offers the bulk of Monday's features at a fairly reasonable monthly cost (compared to Monday's paid competitors). Not only do you gain access to everything within the Basic plan, but you finally gain access to calendars, helpful new board views, as well as integrations and automations galore.

You can also create bespoke templates for different projects within your business (we'll touch more on that in a moment) and store up to 20GB of files, transforming Monday into a genuine business center.

If you're a small to medium-sized business, this is the plan to choose.

{{< button "https://click.nicklafferty.com/monday" "Try The Standard Monday Plan" >}}

#### Pro Features

![Monday Pro Features](/uploads/Monday_Pro.png)

What if you've got a large team that requires top-tier service, and the Standard plan just won't cut it?

That's where the Pro plan comes in.

The Pro plan includes everything from the Basic and Standard plans, alongside enhanced and newly-released features. This includes chart views, powerful insight-oriented dashboards, time-tracking for remote employees, and more. The bump to 25,000 automations per month also transforms the Monday CRM into a dedicated tool capable of managing large customer bases.

And that's not to mention the increase to 100GB of user storage, rivaling paid storage plans like [Google One](https://one.google.com/about/plans). Sure, $16 per user is nothing to sneeze at, but the Pro plan is chock-full of helpful features that'll make managing your business that much easier.

#### Enterprise Features

![Monday Enterprise Features](/uploads/Monday_Enterprise.png)

If you manage a massive and very profitable company (e.g., you're a Fortune 5000 company), you may need to upgrade to the Enterprise plan.

This tier offers bespoke solutions like session management and advanced user permission options, as well as unparalleled customer support from the Monday team. It essentially transforms Monday from a generic all-in-one tool into your *custom* work management hub.

To access the Enterprise plan, you'll need to get in touch with Monday directly.

### **Monday Project Management**

How does Monday.com cover so many aspects of work and project management? And how are companies in entirely different fields — from news agencies to software developers — able to use the same tool to great effect?

It all comes down to Monday's boards, which you can customize to your liking depending on the project at hand. Create tasks, add columns with different data sets, assign permissions, and then send them off to your team! It may take a while to create the perfect workflow, but the control is in your hands.

### Templates

![Monday Project Management Templates](/uploads/Project_Management.png)

Prefer a more hands-off approach? There's where Monday's templates come into play. Templates are pre-made boards with all the fields needed to handle various types of projects.

To access these templates, simply navigate to the Template Center from within Monday's backend, and you'll find boards designed for ventures of all types. Customize these boards to your liking, assign tasks, and *voila!* Your project board is ready to go in a fraction of the time.

In addition to these generic project templates, [Monday](https://click.nicklafferty.com/monday) also offers hundreds of *unique* templates designed exclusively for particular types of businesses, including media companies, creative agencies, and loads of other industries.

What kind of templates can you find? To name just a few, Monday's custom templates include:

- CRMs
- Project Roadmaps
- Digital Asset Management Hubs
- Content Calendars
- Email Marketing Campaign Trackers
- and so much more!

These templates can help you handle every aspect of your workflow while simultaneously keeping your entire company in the loop. If you think about it, that's some serious fire-power that most businesses could only dream of just a few years ago. And now it's available to everyone for a (relatively) low monthly fee.

**Jack-of-All-Trades**

But that's not to say Monday is perfect. To be sure, Monday is a tool that attempts to wear every hat. As such, it's not necessarily equipped to handle the nitty-gritty details within every single niche.

Remember the email marketing template I mentioned? It's great and all, but it's got nothing on dedicated email management [tools like Mailchimp](https://monday.com/integrations), which are laser-focused on managing singular aspects of your workflow.

![Monday Integrations](/uploads/Monday_Integrations.png)

That's the price you pay for an all-in-one platform. It's a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Does that mean it's ineffective? Absolutely not — Monday is an excellent hub for all your projects, and the convenience it offers is well worth a few minor drawbacks. Plus, if you need a specific feature for your project, Monday integrates with dozens of applications... including services like Mailchimp!

Monday even [integrates with Zapier](https://zapier.com/), which extends project functionality further still.

If you've got a team and need to tackle a detailed project, Monday.com is one of the best options in the industry.

## **Free Alternatives to Monday.com**

When it comes to pricing, Monday sits in the higher echelon of work management tools. While it's still fairly reasonable for team-based workflows, it does have its limitations, and there's no free plan to speak of. So, what's the best solution for folks on a budget?

Let's take a look at the top Monday alternatives, starting with one that offers many comparable features without charging a dime.

### **Monday vs. ClickUp**

![Monday vs ClickUp](/uploads/ClickUp.png)

When discussing free alternatives to Monday, ClickUp is one of the most popular options.

Why? Well, [unlike Monday](https://clickup.com/dapulse-monday-alternative), ClickUp offers a free plan that comes jam-packed with an insane amount of functionality. For instance, ClickUp's free tier features various board views, goal tracking, custom fields, and even automated time tracking (the latter two can only found on Monday's **Pro** plan).

The major downside to ClickUp is its lack of storage. Monday's Basic plan comes with 5GB of storage, which dwarfs ClickUp's measly 100MB.

Still, it's tough to beat free. And when/if you *do* need to upgrade, ClickUp offers a simple pricing scheme that costs just $5 per month. Interested and want to learn more? You can [read our full ClickUp review here](https://nicklafferty.com/reviews/clickup/).

### **Monday vs. Asana**

![/uploads/Asana.png](/uploads/Asana.png)

Asana may not be as feature-rich as Monday, but nor does it aim to be. What it *does* aim to do is offer small and medium-sized businesses a robust platform that can handle most day-to-day work management tasks. And it does so at a fraction of the cost of Monday!

That's right — Asana offers a free plan with tons of functionality, including unlimited projects, unlimited storage, and over 100 integrations. Even Monday's Pro plan can't keep up with some of Asana's free features.

That said, If you hope to deep dive into dozens of different project viewpoints or analyze business performance, Asana isn't the best option. But it's still a respectable piece of software trusted by [over 50,000 paying organizations](https://blog.asana.com/2018/09/asana-company-updates-2018/).

[Try Asana](https://asana.com/)

### **Monday vs. Trello**

![/uploads/Trello.png](/uploads/Trello.png)

Next up we have the King of Kanban, Trello.

Trello is a freemium work management SAAS with a reasonable triple-tiered pricing scheme. If you're a budget-conscious entrepreneur, Trello offers everything you need to get started, including their iconic card-based collaboration boards, unlimited tasks, and unlimited file uploads (capped at 10MB per upload).

Trello is used by millions of users and is one of the simplest and most intuitive work management products out there. While it doesn't boast the sheer number of features that Monday does, it's a respectable option for small and medium-sized businesses.

### **Monday vs. Wrike**

![/uploads/Wrike.png](/uploads/Wrike.png)

Read our [full wrike review](/reviews/wrike/).

Wrike is quite similar to Monday in a number of ways. It offers most of the same features, its paid plans prioritize teamwork, and it even has a four-tier pricing structure. The primary difference between the two? Wrike is free.

Well, it's *freemium*, at any rate. Wrike's free plan boasts all the essential work management features you need, including boards, tasks, file-sharing amongst team members, and more. It also comes with multiple integrations out of the box and offers 2GB storage, completely free. Think of it as half as powerful as Wrike's Basic plan, without costing a dime. An excellent option for small teams of up to five.

## **Wrapping Up**

[Monday software](https://click.nicklafferty.com/monday) is an excellent choice for team-based businesses looking to simplify their workflow and increase productivity. No matter what industry you're in, no matter how many team members you have to work with, Monday.com has a plan for you.

As we've discussed, there are two main downsides to Monday: its lack of a free plan and its three team-member minimum requirements. If you're looking to bypass those limitations, Wrike is an excellent free Monday alternative with many of the same features, and it supports teams of various sizes.

Either way, work management for teams has never been so easy, and you've got plenty of excellent options to choose from!
