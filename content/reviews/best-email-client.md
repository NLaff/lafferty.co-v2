How many times did you check your email today? If you're like most Americans, you checked it on [average 15 times today](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annabelacton/2017/07/13/innovators-challenge-how-to-stop-wasting-time-on-emails/?sh=3a71c51a9788).

In other words, you checked email every **37 minutes**. 

The average professional [spends 27% of their workweek](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy#) managing email. That's just over a quarter of their working time wasted. 

If you could cut that time by half you'd increase your productivity by almost 15%.

The good news? The right email client can help you save time, be more productive, which could translate to better job performance, raises, and promotions.

It seems crazy, but the right email software can change your life.

I've put together a list of the best email clients for Mac and Windows.

## What Is An Email Client?

An email client is software that helps process, store, and manage your email. They're typically run as standalone desktop or mobile apps. Web-based, or browser-based, email tools are called web mail clients.  

The two most common browser-based web mail clients are Gmail and Yahoo Mail. 

There are many types of email software, so what's the best one? I'll break down the best email clients for both Windows and Mac as some are only available on one platform. 

## Why Use An Email Client?

Email clients have several advantages over using a web-based mail client.

1. Your data is stored locally on your computer. This enables you to access it offline, for instance on an airplane or bus. 
2. They're more configurable. You have finer controls over settings, shortcuts, and other options.
3. You can manage multiple inboxes. Most people have both a personal and a work email. Email clients let you manage them both in the same application.
4. They connect to many of the common email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook.

## Best Email Clients For Mac

### 1. Superhuman
![Superhuman](/uploads/superhuman_screenshot.png)

[Superhuman](https://www.superhuman.com) is the fastest email experience ever made. Every interaction takes 100ms or less. That's lightning-fast.

I've done a [full review of Superhuman](/reviews/superhuman/) before so make sure to check that out.

#### Pricing

Superhuman costs **$30/month**.

Yes, you read that correctly. 30 bucks for an email client. 

How could it possibly be worth that much?

Here's the thing about Superhuman. Even if you want to use it, you probably won't be able to.

They have a waitlist of more than 275,000 people ahead of you. You can join the waitlist on their website.

Superhuman is part of a new category of software tools catered to the professional consumer, or prosumer.

These people are willing to shell out big bucks to make their professional lives easier and more efficient. Superhuman plugs right into that ecosystem by offering to help you sift through your email in record speed.

Superhuman is best suited for email power users. People who get 1000's of email a day and send 100's back.

#### Features

- Integrates with common email providers like Gmail
- The best shortcuts of any app I've used
- A white-glove on-boarding experience. A real human walks you through your first 30 minutes using Superhuman on a video call.
- Customizable snippets to create templates for common responses.

### 2. Spark

![Spark Email App](/uploads/spark.png)
I personally used Spark before I received my Superhuman invite. Spark is one of the best free email clients because of it's feature set and flexibility. 

The downside? Spark is only available for Macs right now. 

Spark for Windows is coming soon but is not currently available. I'll update this post when it launches. 

#### Pricing

Spark has two pricing tiers, a Free tier and a Premium tier.

Premium starts at $7.99/month and includes the following features:

- Priority Support
- 10gb file storage (up from 5gb on the free plan)
- Unlimited collaborators (up from 2 on the free plan)
- Unlimited templates (up from 5 on the free plan)

The great thing about Spark is you don't need to pay for it. The free features are perfectly fine for the average email user.

#### Features

Here are my favorite Spark features:

- Snooze emails for later
- A smart inbox powered by AI
- Google Docs like team collaboration features.
- Reply templates
- Dark mode
- Send later
- Integrations with Dropbox, Google Drive, Pocket, and more.

### 3. Airmail
![Airmail Email Client](/uploads/airmail.png)

My experience with email clients started with Airmail around 2014. Airmail won an Apple Design Award in 2017 and it shows, their app is gorgeous. 

Airmail set the design standard for what the best email clients on Mac should look like. 

I first used Airmail when their pricing model was a one-time payment. I think I paid like $20 or $30 and got access to the current version and the next one.

Eventually they switched to a subscription model.

#### Pricing

Airmail has a free tier, and their professional level costs **$2.99/month** or **$9.99/year**.

The pricing is reasonable, especially compared to Superhuman. 

#### Features

Here's a short list of Airmail's features:

- Multi-accounts
- Unified inbox
- Send later
- Snooze
- Privacy mode
- Full iPhone and iPad support.

I eventually stopped using Airmail when my version was outdated, but it's still a solid email client.

### 4. eM Client
![eM Client Email](/uploads/emclient.png)

This is the first email software on the list that is compatible with both Macs and PCs.

#### Pricing

eM Client has a free tier that is perfect for the casual email user.

It's limited to only 2 email accounts and doesn't have several of the advanced features I'll list below.

They do offer a free 30 day trial of their Pro plan to give you time to test it out.

The main downside to the Free plan is it's not allowed for commercial use, which includes for business use. 

eM Client's Pro pricing is a one-time payment of $50.

That payment gives you access to the current version. When the next version launches you'll need to pay a little bit extra (currently $29) to upgrade.

You can also purchase a lifetime license for an additional $70.

Those prices are steep compared to the smaller monthly fees of Spark or Airmail, but the flip-side is you only have one payment. 

#### Features

Here are the premium features only available on eM Client's Pro plan:

- Commercial use
- Notes
- Snooze email
- Send later
- Message encryption

eM Client is a solid alternative to Spark and Airmail for users who dislike adding yet another monthly subscription to life.

### 5. Thunderbird
![Thunderbird Email Client](/uploads/thunderbird.png)

Thunderbird is old school, it launched in 2004. It's the only fully-free and open source email client on this list.

It's also built by Mozilla, the folks behind the popular Firefox browser. 

Open source software is popular with developers, and for good reason. It promotes better software that is community supported.

I used Thunderbird almost 10 years ago, and the landscape of email clients has changed drastically since then. 

Thunderbird is the most Outlook-like email client on this list. By that I mean its design and feature set most mirror Microsoft's famous Outlook email software. There's even a built in calendar, tasks, and chat.

#### Pricing

Thunderbird is free. Forever.

#### Features

The coolest feature of Thunderbird is its tabs, similar to most modern web browsers. 

Here's a short list of Thunderbird's features:

- Privacy first. Do-not-track settings.
- Add-ons and extensions, similar to Firefox.
- OpenPGP encryption
- Open source, funded by donations.
- Tabbed email

### 6. Postbox
![Postbox Email Software](/uploads/postbox.png)

Private. Secure. Powerful.

That's how Postbox describes itself when you first land on their website. 

Postbox is compatible with both Macs and PCs, like eM Client and Thunderbird. 

Here's Postbox's commitment to Privacy:

- We will not transmit your email data to our servers.
- We will not scan your emails, looking for data to sell.
- We will not target you with 3rd-party ads.
- We will not share your personal information with anyone, ever.
- We will not censor, filter, or log your content in any way.

I love that they come out and list that right on their homepage. Privacy is so important now with companies like Google and Facebook using and selling as much of your data as they can get their hands on. 

Your email should be a private space that only you have access to. 

#### Pricing

Postbox has one pricing tier.

You pay once and get lifetime access. Right now the price is 33% off: $39.

That's a great deal for a private and secure email client.

Your Postbox license is good to use on as many computers as you own. It's a personal license and supports as many inboxes as you have too. 

#### Features

Postbox has some great features for it's price point

- Works with all popular email providers
- Grouped accounts
- Folders
- Tabbed Email
- Fast & powerful search
- Templates & pre-canned responses
- Full HTML code editor
- Dark mode
- Full theme support

Postbox is an attractive option for anyone looking for a privacy-first email client that is supported on both Windows and Macs.

## Best Email Clients for Windows 10

### 1. Mailbird
![Mailbird Email](/uploads/mailbird.png)

Mailbird is an email client for Windows. It does not currently support Macs but it's on the roadmap. I'll update this post when that version comes out. 

It's nice to see an email client support Windows right out the gate. Usually developers will start with Mac support and then move over to Windows.

Mailbird supports many themes and layouts that are optimized for Windows. 

It also integrates with Google Calendar, WhatsApp, Dropbox, Twitter, Slack, and more

#### Pricing

Mailbird costs $39/year, or you can buy a lifetime license for $79.

I'm a fan of the one-time payment for email clients, and Mailbird has a good pricing structure.

There is no free version, but Mailbird has a 14 day money back guarantee. So you can try it out and get a full refund if you don't like it.

#### Features

- Unified Inbox
- Customizable Layout
- Windows support
- App integrations
- Snooze
- Dark Theme
- LinkedIn lookup
