## ClickUp vs Monday

ClickUp is an extremely attractive competitor to [Monday](https://click.nicklafferty.com/monday) based on Pricing and Features.

### Pricing

| Plan | ClickUp | Monday |  
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Free | $0 | No Free Plan |
| Basic | $9  | $36 |
| Pro | $19 | $59 |

ClickUp has a free plan, Monday does not.

ClickUp's cheapest paid plan is $9/month, compared to Monday's $36/month. The main difference is Monday charges a minimum of 3 users, which ratchets up the price.

The next level up ClickUp is $40 cheaper per month than Monday for similar features. It's really no contest between the two on pricing.

**Winner**: [ClickUp](https://click.nicklafferty.com/clickup)

## ClickUp vs Wrike

At both pricing levels Wrike is slightly more expensive than ClickUp, but the difference isn't meaningful. Here's how Wrike and Clickup compare on price.

| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Free | $0 | $0 |
| Basic | $9  | $9.80 |
| Pro | $19 | $24.80 |


### Features
Wrike has many of the same features as ClickUp, but ClickUp offers many of them in their free plan, and Wrike gates them behind the Professional plan.

Both have Gantt charts, Kanban boards, and easy to use default templates. 

Here's a short feature comparison.

| Feature | ClickUp | Wrike |  
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Slash Commands | No | Yes |
| Custom Statuses | Yes | Yes | 
| Multiple Assignees | Yes | Yes|

**Winner**: [ClickUp](https://click.nicklafferty.com/clickup)

### Wrike Alternatives
Both [Monday](https://click.nicklafferty.com/monday) and [ClickUp](https://click.nicklafferty.com/clickup) are good alternatives to Wrike. Monday is the more expensive option due to it's forced 3-user minimum pricing plans. ClickUp is a more affordable option.


## ClickUp Integrations
![Clickup Calendar](/uploads/clickup_cal.png)

CLickUp has native integrations with Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Google Docs, Dropbox, Outlook, and hundreds more.

Many of their integrations are built and maintained in-house, so they'll be updated frequently and ideally free of bugs. 

If they don't have an integration listed, their API is available and seems very robust.

ClickUp also integrates with Zapier which unlocks 1,000+ other integrations that require some additional setup on your part.

## Conclusion

ClickUp is a competitive entry into the workplace productivity tools. Their plan to consolidate many tools into one is a compelling for many people. There is so much software in the world today, people only have time to use so many things before it becomes overwhelming. 

They're significantly cheaper than their main competitor, [Monday](https://click.nicklafferty.com/monday). Personally I find Monday absurdly expensive, and their pricing model turns off many consumers looking for a one-user tool.
